# AN.APIDemo
This C# .NET solution illustrates how you can interact with the AppNotch Tenant API that will enable automation for your organization.

What is in the solution?
========================================================
1.) AN.APIWrapper : A C# class library that contains the wrapper for creating the JWT token and the wrapper to execute
    the tenant API.
2.) AN.APITest : Test project. To be able to run the tests within this project, you need to configure the TenantTestData.cs class found
    within this project.

A couple you need to know aside from C# programming knowlege and the .NET framework
========================================================
1.) This project uses JWT Nuget package. (https://github.com/jwt-dotnet/jwt)
2.) This project uses Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package to serialize/deserialize the parameters and result from the API calls.
3.) The API User and Secret are stored in the config file which are being ulled by a static class called Configration.
4.) If you are curious about the authorization part, look into AppNotchJwt class within the demo project.

How to use the TenantAPI?
========================================================
1.) Acquire API username and secret from AppNotch website.
2.) Add the following to your AppSettings.Config
	<appSettings>
		<add key="AN-Subject" value="api user"/>
		<add key="AN-Secret" value="secret"/>
		<add key="AN-APIUrl" value="https://apiqa.appnotch.com/"/>
	</appSettings>	
3.) Add reference to the class library project then initialize an instance of the TenantAPI class then call API methods directly from it.
	var tenantApi = new TenantAPI();
	var tenants = tenantApi.GetActiveTenants(1 /* my app id */);
	
4.) Calling methods within this class will handle creation of JWT tokens (per request) add it into the header for the request and return
the result is applicable.
